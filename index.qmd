## The Problem: Mastering Object-Oriented Matplotlib Through the Four Stages

**Core Question:** How can we create compelling, professional data visualizations using object-oriented matplotlib and the four stages of visualization?

**The Challenge:** Real-world data visualization requires more than just plotting data - it requires a systematic approach that transforms raw data into compelling stories. The four stages framework provides a proven methodology for creating visualizations that inform, persuade, and inspire action.

**Our Approach:** We'll work with baseball stadium data to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly ballpark in Major League Baseball. This investigation will take us through all four stages of visualization, demonstrating object-oriented matplotlib techniques along the way.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance ‚Üí Awareness ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Four Stages of Data Visualization

The four essential stages for creating effective visualizations are:

1. **Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose** - Define your message and audience
2. **Stage 2: Curation of Content** - Gather and create all necessary data
3. **Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings** - Choose geometry and aesthetics
4. **Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience** - Polish for professional presentation

## Data and Business Context

We analyze Major League Baseball stadium data to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly ballpark. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Real Business Question:** Sports analysts and fans want to understand stadium effects on scoring
- **Clear Hypothesis:** High altitude should make Coors Field more run-friendly
- **Multiple Metrics:** We can analyze both total runs and home runs
- **Visualization Practice:** Perfect for demonstrating all four stages of visualization

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration

Let's start by loading the baseball data and understanding what we're working with.

```{python}
#| label: load-data
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns

# Load 2010 baseball season data
df2010 = pd.read_csv("baseball10.csv")

# Load 2021 baseball season data for comparison
df2021 = pd.read_csv("baseball21.csv")

print("2010 data shape:", df2010.shape)
print("2021 data shape:", df2021.shape)
print("\n2010 data columns:", df2010.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of 2010 data:")
print(df2010.head())
```

::: {.callout-note}
## üí° Understanding the Data

**Baseball Game Data:** Contains information about each game, including:
- `home`: Home team (3-letter code)
- `visiting`: Visiting team (3-letter code)
- `homeScore`: Runs scored by home team
- `visScore`: Runs scored by visiting team
- `homeHR`: Home runs by home team
- `visHR`: Home runs by visiting team
- `date`: Game date

**Business Questions We'll Answer:**
1. Is Coors Field (COL) the most run-friendly ballpark in 2010?
2. How does this change in 2021?
3. What's the difference between total runs and home runs by stadium?
:::

## Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose

**Mental Model:** Start with a clear message and bold title that states your recommendation.

Our purpose is to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly baseball stadium in Major League Baseball.

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 1 - Declaration of Purpose

**Question 1: Hypothesis Formation**
- Why might high altitude affect baseball performance?  Is Coors Field affected by high altitude?

High altitude reduces air density, causing baseballs to travel farther with less air resistance and making pitches easier to hit. Coors Field in Denver sits at 5,200 feet above sea level - the highest elevation in MLB - creating the well-documented "Coors Effect" where balls travel 5-10% farther, resulting in significantly more runs scored per game compared to sea-level stadiums.

:::

## Stage 2: Curation of Content

**Mental Model:** Gather and create all the data you need to support your message.

Let's aggregate the data to get average runs per stadium:

```{python}
#| label: stage-2-content
#| echo: true

# Stage 2: Curation of Content
# Aggregate data to get average runs per stadium

# Process 2010 data
avgDF_2010 = (df2010
    .assign(totalRuns = lambda df: df.homeScore + df.visScore)
    .assign(totalHR = lambda df: df.homeHR + df.visHR)
    .drop(columns = ['date', 'visiting'])
    .groupby(['home'], as_index=False)
    .mean()
)

# Process 2021 data
avgDF_2021 = (df2021
    .assign(totalRuns = lambda df: df.homeScore + df.visScore)
    .assign(totalHR = lambda df: df.homeHR + df.visHR)
    .drop(columns = ['date', 'visiting'])
    .groupby(['home'], as_index=False)
    .mean()
)

print("2010 Stadium Averages (Top 5):")
print(avgDF_2010.head())
print("\n2021 Stadium Averages (Top 5):")
print(avgDF_2021.head())
```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 2 - Curation of Content

**Question 1: Data Aggregation Strategy**
- How many games are in the dataset? Why do we aggregate individual games into stadium averages before we start the visualization process?

There are 2,430 games in the 2010 dataset and 2,429 games in the 2021 dataset (all MLB games for each season). We aggregate individual games into stadium averages before we start the visualization process because we want to compare the average runs and home runs scored by each stadium across all games played in that stadium. This allows us to see the overall performance of each stadium and compare them to each other.

```{python}
#| label: calculate-games-and-aggregation
#| echo: true

# Count games in each dataset
print("2010 games:", len(df2010))
print("2021 games:", len(df2021))

# Show why we aggregate - individual games vary too much
print("\nSample individual games:")
print(df2010[['home', 'homeScore', 'visScore']].head(5))

print("\nStadium averages (much cleaner):")
print(avgDF_2010[['home', 'totalRuns']].head())
```

:::

## Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings

**Mental Model:** Choose the right geometry and aesthetics to effectively communicate your message.

Let's explore different visual approaches:

```{python}
#| label: stage-3-mapping-exploration
#| echo: true

# Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings
# Explore different geometries and aesthetics

# Sort data for better visualization
avgDF_2010_sorted = avgDF_2010.sort_values('totalRuns', ascending=True)

# Create figure with subplots to compare approaches
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(8, 6))

# Approach 1: Scatter plot (not ideal for categorical data)
axes[0,0].scatter(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[0,0].set_title("Approach 1: Scatter Plot")
axes[0,0].set_xlabel("Stadium")
axes[0,0].set_ylabel("Average Runs")

# Approach 2: Horizontal bar chart (better for categorical data)
axes[0,1].barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[0,1].set_title("Approach 2: Horizontal Bar Chart")
axes[0,1].set_xlabel("Average Runs")
axes[0,1].set_ylabel("Stadium")

# Approach 3: Vertical bar chart
axes[1,0].bar(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[1,0].set_title("Approach 3: Vertical Bar Chart")
axes[1,0].set_xlabel("Stadium")
axes[1,0].set_ylabel("Average Runs")
axes[1,0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)

# Approach 4: Highlight Colorado
colorado_colors = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                   for stadium in avgDF_2010_sorted.home]
axes[1,1].barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors)
axes[1,1].set_title("Approach 4: Highlight Colorado")
axes[1,1].set_xlabel("Average Runs")
axes[1,1].set_ylabel("Stadium")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 3 - Structuring of Visual Mappings

**Question 1: Geometry Choices**
- Why is a horizontal bar chart better than a scatter plot for this data?
- When would you choose a vertical bar chart over horizontal?

A horizontal bar chart is better than a scatter plot because we're comparing categorical data (stadiums) rather than continuous variables, and it makes stadium names easier to read. You would choose a vertical bar chart over horizontal when you have fewer categories (5-10 items) or when stadium names are short enough to fit without rotation.


**Question 2: Aesthetic Mappings**
- What does the color highlighting accomplish in Approach 4?
- How does position (x/y) compare to color for encoding data?

The color highlighting in Approach 4 draws immediate attention to Colorado (COL) as the standout performer, making it easy to identify the highest-scoring stadium at a glance. Position (x/y coordinates) is better for encoding precise quantitative values, while color is better for highlighting specific categories or drawing attention to particular data points.

## Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience

**Mental Model:** Polish your visualization for professional presentation.

Let's create a publication-ready visualization:

```{python}
#| label: stage-4-formatting
#| echo: true

# Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience
# Create a professional, publication-ready visualization

# Set style for professional appearance
plt.style.use("seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid")

# Create the main visualization
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))

# Create color array for highlighting Colorado
colorado_colors = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                   for stadium in avgDF_2010_sorted.home]

# Create horizontal bar chart
bars = ax.barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors)

# Add title and labels
ax.set_title("Colorado (COL) is the Most Run-Friendly Ballpark in 2010", 
             fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', pad=20)
ax.set_xlabel("Average Runs Per Game", fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel("Stadium (Home Team)", fontsize=12)

# Add legend
colorado_bar = plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color="darkorchid", label="Colorado Rockies")
other_bar = plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color="lightgrey", label="Other Stadiums")
ax.legend(handles=[colorado_bar, other_bar], loc='lower right', frameon=True)

# Add annotation for Colorado
colorado_index = avgDF_2010_sorted[avgDF_2010_sorted.home == "COL"].index[0]
colorado_runs = avgDF_2010_sorted[avgDF_2010_sorted.home == "COL"]["totalRuns"].iloc[0]
ax.annotate(f"COL: {colorado_runs:.2f} runs/game", 
            xy=(colorado_runs, colorado_index), 
            xytext=(colorado_runs + 0.5, colorado_index),
            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='darkorchid', lw=2),
            fontsize=10, fontweight='bold', color='darkorchid')

# Set x-axis to start from 0 for better comparison
ax.set_xlim(0, max(avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns) * 1.1)

# Add grid for easier reading
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print summary statistics
print(f"\nSummary Statistics for 2010:")
print(f"Colorado (COL) average runs per game: {colorado_runs:.2f}")
print(f"League average runs per game: {avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Colorado is {((colorado_runs / avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean()) - 1) * 100:.1f}% above league average")
```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 4 - Formatting for Your Audience

**Question 1: Professional Formatting**
- What elements make this visualization suitable for a business presentation?
- Is the annotation on the visualization helpful?  Can you fix its placement?

The visualization is suitable for business presentations because it has a clear, bold title that states the main finding, professional color scheme with strategic highlighting, clean grid lines for easy reading, and a legend that explains the color coding. The annotation is helpful but could be improved by placing it closer to the Colorado bar.

## Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques

**Mental Model:** Use object-oriented matplotlib to create complex, reusable visualizations.

Let's create a comprehensive comparison between 2010 and 2021:

```{python}
#| label: advanced-oo-techniques
#| echo: true

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques
# Create a comprehensive comparison visualization

# Prepare data for comparison
comparison_data = pd.merge(
    avgDF_2010[['home', 'totalRuns']].rename(columns={'totalRuns': 'runs_2010'}),
    avgDF_2021[['home', 'totalRuns']].rename(columns={'totalRuns': 'runs_2021'}),
    on='home', how='inner'
)

# Create side-by-side comparison visualization using object-oriented matplotlib
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7, 5))

# Sort data for both years
avgDF_2010_sorted = avgDF_2010.sort_values('totalRuns', ascending=True)
avgDF_2021_sorted = avgDF_2021.sort_values('totalRuns', ascending=True)

# Create color arrays for highlighting Colorado
colorado_colors_2010 = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                        for stadium in avgDF_2010_sorted.home]
colorado_colors_2021 = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                        for stadium in avgDF_2021_sorted.home]

# Left plot - 2010
bars1 = ax1.barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors_2010)
ax1.set_title("2010: Colorado Leads in Run-Friendliness", fontsize=14, fontweight='bold', pad=20)
ax1.set_xlabel("Average Runs Per Game", fontsize=8)
ax1.set_ylabel("Stadium (Home Team)", fontsize=8)
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelsize=6)
ax1.set_xlim(0, max(avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns) * 1.1)
ax1.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Right plot - 2021
bars2 = ax2.barh(avgDF_2021_sorted.home, avgDF_2021_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors_2021)
ax2.set_title("2021: Colorado Maintains Dominance", fontsize=14, fontweight='bold', pad=20)
ax2.set_xlabel("Average Runs Per Game", fontsize=8)
ax2.set_ylabel("Stadium (Home Team)", fontsize=8)
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelsize=6)
ax2.set_xlim(0, max(avgDF_2021_sorted.totalRuns) * 1.1)
ax2.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Add annotations for Colorado directly after the bar
for ax, data in [(ax1, avgDF_2010_sorted), (ax2, avgDF_2021_sorted)]:
    if "COL" in data.home.values:
        colorado_runs = data[data.home == "COL"]["totalRuns"].iloc[0]
        # Use a small offset so the annotation sits just after the bar
        ax.text(colorado_runs + max(data.totalRuns) * 0.01,  # small offset proportional to axis
                "COL", f"{colorado_runs:.2f}",
                fontsize=9, fontweight='bold', color='darkorchid',
                ha='left', va='center')

# Add overall title
fig.suptitle("Coors Field: Consistently the Most Run-Friendly Ballpark", 
             fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', y=0.95)

# Add legend
colorado_bar = plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color="darkorchid", label="Colorado Rockies")
other_bar = plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color="lightgrey", label="Other Stadiums")
fig.legend(handles=[colorado_bar, other_bar], loc='lower center', 
           bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, -0.05), ncol=2, frameon=True)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print comparison statistics
print("Comparison Statistics:")
print(f"2010 - COL average: {avgDF_2010_sorted[avgDF_2010_sorted.home == 'COL']['totalRuns'].iloc[0]:.2f}")
print(f"2021 - COL average: {avgDF_2021_sorted[avgDF_2021_sorted.home == 'COL']['totalRuns'].iloc[0]:.2f}")
print(f"2010 - League average: {avgDF_2010_sorted['totalRuns'].mean():.2f}")
print(f"2021 - League average: {avgDF_2021_sorted['totalRuns'].mean():.2f}")

```

## ü§î Discussion Questions: Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques

**Question 1: Using Subplot Layout**
- Create a two-facet visualization that shows the total runs for 2010 and 2021 for each stadium in a single figure.  Highlight Colorado in the visualization.

**Question 2: Explanation of the Visualization**
- Ask AI To Add A Paragraph Here To Explain The Visualization
- Does AI come to the right conclusion?  If not, why not?

This visualization displays average total runs scored per game at each Major League Baseball stadium for the 2010 and 2021 seasons, placing the two years side-by-side for easy comparison. Each bar represents a team's home stadium, with Coors Field (home of the Colorado Rockies, "COL") uniquely highlighted in purple. By separating the seasons into two horizontal bar charts, the figure allows the viewer to assess both the general distribution of scoring environments across stadiums and the exceptional offensiveness of Coors Field. The fact that Colorado's bar is noticeably longer than those of other stadiums in both years, and clearly stands out in color, visually confirms that Coors Field is indeed the most run-friendly ballpark in Major League Baseball for both seasons analyzed. This supports the hypothesis about high altitude influencing game outcomes and provides a clear, data-driven narrative for business or sports analysis audiences.


This is incorrect, Colarado is not the most run-friendly ballpark in 2021. The visualization is correct, but the conclusion is incorrect.
